# Design Notes

## Instagram

The major design flaws i noticed in instagram website was it was really hard to explore content. there is this section called reels where i could see short form content. i only get suggested content more than anything. it doesn't have group feature for collaboration and sharing ideas. there are certain features and functions work only good in instagram mobile app. so in web version it often feels like a mess. I love the alignment of different things to the appropriate place.

## craigslist

the website logo and it appearance could be improved. the fonts are all lowercase letters and there is no animations and good image which could attract user attention. it is hard to guess the usage flow of the website. icons could be more clear if they were bigger and same for the fonts. i love the minimal approach of the website.

## github

there is top repository section which ranks the repositories based on some arbitrary criteria. the homepage feed is broken most of the time. i like how the copilot has been seemlessly integrated into the website. it says dashboard but there is nothing like dashboard.

## reddit

i love the fact that they've put everything in good place. the post gapping is not really visible. the r/ something which is exclusive to reddit is really cool but confusing on the other hand. the font size is really small and the letter spacing could be improved.

## paulgraham

the website is not look visually appealing. the spacing and choosen font is not very good. there is heck lot of space in the website.

## supreme.com

the fonts are small and unreadable. one cannot understand what the website is about. hard to navigate and identify links and contents.
